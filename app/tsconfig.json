    // Like in our main tsconfig.json, we want to be as conservative as possible,

    // will require a more recent Node, then it's okay to bump our app compilerOptions
    // to what's supported by the more recent Node.

    // believe people who know which {syntax, library} parts of current EcmaScript
    // are supported for the version of Node coming with the Electron being used,
    // and use what they recommend. For the current Node version, I followed
    // https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51716406/typescript-tsconfig-settings-for-node-js-10
    // and 'dom' to tell tsc it's okay to use the URL object (which is in Node >= 7)
